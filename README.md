## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Well did'nt anything new but this project made me solidify my grid and flexbox prowess

### Continued development

So if you noticed it is'nt responsive yet .
Well i tried writing a responsive code for it but it was quite difficult, messy and and a lot of stress.
I think it the way i wrote the HTML so am going to come back very soon and remodel this site
